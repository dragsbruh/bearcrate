# BearCrate

> A minimalistic dive into baremetal software crafting, just for kicks 🚀

**LATEST UPDATE:** Nothing (0.0.0)

## Overview

BearCrate is a side project born out of the ashes of AristoCrates, a project abandoned due to unnecessary complexity. Unlike its predecessor, BearCrate strips away the excess and embraces simplicity. It's not here to solve real-world problems but to offer a light-hearted, baremetal coding experience, just for the fun of it.

## Building

**Prerequisites:**

- `git` installed.
- V compiler. Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/vlang/v#installing-v-from-source) for installation.

**Build steps:**

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/dragsbruh/bearcrate`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd bearcrate`
3. Compile and run using `v run .`

**NOTE:** For a binary build, use the `v .` command.

*These instructions work on major operating systems.*

## Seriously

BearCrate doesn't take itself too seriously. It won't revolutionize coding, but it might bring a smile to your face. And yes this is the goal of the project not the truth or smth. 😉

## Technical Info

BearCrate, fundamentally, is an interpreter, or to be more precise, a virtual machine. It's all about that old-school developer experience, providing a taste of the golden times without overwhelming complexity. ✨

**Terms:**

1. **BSM:** BearCrate's assembly-like language.
2. **Hug:** Not a term, just what BearCrate gives you when you run your code. 🐻🫂

**Misunderstandings:**

Well uh in [Overview](#overview) its specified that BearCrate is simple. Well technically the syntax is simple.
You will know why I wrote this later.

**Language:**

As mentioned BearCrate will have its own assembly like language, which it will interpret, but in the future I hope I will make a bytecode compiler for it.
More information on the language and docs later 👍
